Custom uploader control for Alfresco Share
======================================

Author: ITD Systems

This project defines a custom control that provides a way of uploading files
through Share workflow form.

Installation
------------

The add-on has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.4 installation.

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the 
custom files, which can then be installed into the 'tomcat/shared/lib' folder 
of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project 
directory.

    ant clean dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file named alvex-uploader.jar
in the 'build/dist' directory within your project.

To deploy the control files into a local Tomcat instance for testing, you can 
use the hotcopy-tomcat-jar task. You will need to set the tomcat.home
property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=/home/username/Alfresco/tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar
    
Once you have run this you will need to restart Tomcat so that the classpath 
resources in the JAR file are picked up.

Using the control
-----------------

Copy the alvex-uploader.jar to tomcat lib directory.

Update your share form configuration files so that whenever bpm:package is used
<appearance>
   <field id="bpm:package">
      <control template="/alvex-uploader.ftl" />
   </field>
</appearance>

Customizing control
-------------

    alfresco://company/home).
    Default to "alfresco://user/home".

  * <control-param name="uploadDirectory">path/to/dir</control-param>
