Custom orgchart control for Alfresco Share
======================================

Author: ITD Systems

This project defines a custom control that provides a way of choosing 
people from orgchart in Share workflow form.

Installation
------------

The add-on has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.4 installation.

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the 
custom files, which can then be installed into the 'tomcat/shared/lib' folder 
of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project 
directory.

    ant clean dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file in the 'build/dist' directory within your project.

To deploy the control files into a local Tomcat instance for testing, you can 
use the hotcopy-tomcat-jar task. You will need to set the tomcat.home
property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=/home/username/Alfresco/tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar
    
Once you have run this you will need to restart Tomcat so that the classpath 
resources in the JAR file are picked up.

Using the control
-----------------

Copy JAR file to tomcat lib directory.

Update your share form configuration files to use the control
<field id="bpm:assignees" set="other">
   <control template="/orgchart-picker.ftl" />
</field>
